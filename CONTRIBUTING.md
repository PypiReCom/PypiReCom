## Project Overview

**Repository Name:** PypiReCom

**Description:** PypiReCom is a tool designed to help developers find the best Python packages on PyPI for their specific needs, simplifying the package selection process.

For more detailed information, please refer to our [README.md](README.md).

## Branches

We have multiple active branches to organize development efforts, but as a contributor, you will be working on one of these two:

- **`Dev_V2`**
- **`Dev_V3`**

Each issue will specify the branch where changes should be made, indicated like `<ISSUE> #Dev_V2`. Please ensure you're working on the correct branch as specified in the issue.

## Issues and Labels

We maintain a list of [issues](https://github.com/PypiReCom/PypiReCom/issues) categorized with appropriate labels to help you find tasks that suit your interests and skills. Issues include:

- **Branch to Work On:** Indicated in the issue title or description.
- **Task Description:** A brief overview of what needs to be done.

Feel free to browse through the issues and pick one that you'd like to work on. If you identify a bug or have an idea for an enhancement, you're welcome to [submit your own issue](#submitting-your-own-issues).
